# Very simple Asset Service Example

Base for this example is the Predix WebApp Starter project.
Main objective is to provide a lean example that demonstrates the end-to-end integration between the Predix asset service and a web frontend.
This example is not using the asset bootstrap SDK; It is plain Node.js implementation to access assets from the backend service in a Predix-UI (Polymer) frontend.

## Getting Started

### Get the source code
Make a directory for your project.  Clone or download and extract the starter in that directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/cobra79/predix-webapp-starter.git  
cd predix-webapp-starter
```

### Install tools
If you don't have them already, you'll need node, bower and gulp to be installed globally on your machine.  

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  This includes npm - the node package manager.  
2. Install [bower](https://bower.io/) globally `npm install bower -g`  
3. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally `npm install gulp-cli -g`  

### Install the dependencies
Change directory into the new project you just cloned, then install dependencies.
```
npm install
bower install
```

### For this example a real asset-service instance must be used.
Enter the details of your uaa and asset service at least in the localConfig.json 
(to run also the app.js part in the cloud the service information needs to be copied to the manifest)

You need to set:
```
"uaaURL": "https://<your uaa id>.predix-uaa.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io",
"base64ClientCredential": "<base 64 encoded client credentials>",
"loginBase64ClientCredential": "<base 64 encoded client credentials>",
...
"assetURL": "https://predix-asset.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io",
"assetZoneId": "<your asset zone id>",
...
```

## Running the app locally
The default gulp task will start a local web server.  Just run this command:
```
gulp
```
Browse to http://localhost:5000.
Initially, the app will use mock data for the views service, asset service, and time series service.
Later you can connect your app to real instances of these services.

## Running in Predix Cloud
With a few commands you can build a distribution version of the app, and deploy it to the cloud.

### Create a distribution version
Use gulp to create a distribution version of your app, which contains vulcanized files for more efficient serving.
You will need to run this command every time before you deploy to the Cloud.
```
gulp dist
```


## Push to the Cloud

### Pre-Requisites
Pushing (deploying) to a cloud environment requires knowledge of the commands involved and a valid user account with the environment.  GE uses Cloud Foundry for its cloud platform.  For information on Cloud Foundry, refer to this [link](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/index.html).

### Steps
The simplest way to push the Starter application to a cloud environment is by modifying the default manifest file (manifest.yml) and using the **cf push** command, as follows:

1. Update manifest.yml

    Change the name field in your manifest.yml.  
    Uncomment the services section, and change the names to match your service instances.
    Uncomment the two base64ClientCredential environment variables and enter the correct values for your UAA clients.
    ```
    ---
    applications:
      - name: my-predix-starter
        memory: 64M
        buildpack: nodejs_buildpack
        command: node server/app.js
    #services:
     # - <your-name>-secure-uaa-instance
     # - <your-name>-timeseries-instance
     # - <your-name>-asset-instance
    env:
        node_env: cloud
        uaa_service_label : predix-uaa
        # Add these values for authentication in the cloud
        #base64ClientCredential: dWFhLWNsaWVudC1pZDp1YWEtY2xpZW50LWlkLXNlY3JldA==
        #loginBase64ClientCredential: bG9naW5fY2xpZW50X2lkOnNlY3JldA==
    ```

2. Push to the cloud.

    ```
    cf push
    ```

3. Access the cloud deployment of your Starter application

  The output of the **cf push** command includes the URL to which your application was deployed.  Below is an example:

    ```
    Showing health and status for app my-predix-starter in org my-org / space dev as developer@gmail.com...
    OK

    requested state: started
    instances: 1/1
    usage: 128M x 1 instances
    urls: my-predix-starter.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io
    last uploaded: Mon Apr 17 18:35:03 UTC 2017
    stack: cflinuxfs2
    buildpack: nodejs_buildpack

        state     since                    cpu    memory          disk          details
    #0   running   2017-04-17 11:35:40 AM   0.0%   63.5M of 128M   90.9M of 1G
    ```  

  Access your Starter application by adding "https://" to the beginning of the URL, and loading that URL in a web browser.
